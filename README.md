This tool helped automate a cumbersome process by automatically deriving the correct disposition codes and languages needed to process a case



## Description
An opportunity was identified to offload some work to an offshore BPO partner - this offloading would significantly reduce the time spent on a task, translating to more than $5,000 Dollars in labor costs savings each month.
The biggest obstacle to offloading this process was the need to manually research different pieces of information and reference multiple documents to arrive at the correct decision - something which the BPO's representatives were not capable of handling.

To circumvent this, the "Unreviewed.Policies.Tool" was created; it eliminates the need to manually analyze all the different data points needed to make a decision given that its formulas, rules, and mini-knowledge banks automatically provide the correct action to be taken. As a result,  the task was given to the offshore BPO partners now that they only needed to copy and paste the information provided to them by the tool.
